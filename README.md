# ASSOCIATE
### A Simulator for Assessing Soft Security in the Cognitive Internet of Things

---


**ASSOCIATE** is a modular and multi-layered simulation tool developed for evaluating soft security models in the context of the Cognitive Internet of Things (CIoT). It enables researchers to simulate and assess the effectiveness of soft security models, specifically focusing on trust and security in CIoT systems.

## Features

- **Modular Architecture**: ASSOCIATE is designed with a modular architecture consisting of three main components: the Society Generation Module (SGM), Simulator Module (SiM), and World Space (WSM). This modular design allows for independent upgrades and modifications to each module and layer, facilitating adaptability to evolving security requirements.
- **Comprehensive CIoT Environment**: The World Space (WSM) component of ASSOCIATE encompasses four layers: society, transition, trust, and the Internet, providing a comprehensive representation of the CIoT environment. This enables researchers to study the dynamics of social behaviors, trust relationships, and system performance in CIoT systems.
- **Flexible Society Generation**: The Society Generation Module (SGM) allows researchers to create diverse and customized societies by specifying desired characteristics through a configuration file. This empowers security engineers to define various scenarios and evaluate different trust profiles in CIoT simulations.
- **Visualization and Reporting**: ASSOCIATE generates visual representations of evaluation results in the form of charts and graphs. These visualizations provide valuable insights into the performance and effectiveness of soft security models under different scenarios. The results can be saved in image and CSV file formats, facilitating further analysis and comparison.
